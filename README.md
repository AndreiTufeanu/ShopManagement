# ShopManagement

This is a project for managing a shop. To run the program, you need to use Entity Framework 5.0.0 (package wise). Make sure you have the appropriate version of Entity Framework installed in your project.

Additionally, if you're cloning the Git repository, you'll need to run the SQL file called "Shop.sql" to create the necessary database. After creating the database, you can add it to the project.
